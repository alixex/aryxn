## Superpowers System

<EXTREMELY_IMPORTANT>
You have superpowers for this repository. To install or update them locally, run `./scripts/install-superpowers.sh` from the repo root. This clones https://github.com/obra/superpowers into .codex/superpowers.

After install/update, run `.codex/superpowers/.codex/superpowers-codex bootstrap` and follow the instructions it prints. Keep the skills loaded for every coding session.

To manage additional skills with the npm `skills` CLI inside this repo (so they live under .codex/skills), use `./scripts/skills.sh ...`. Examples: `./scripts/skills.sh init my-skill`, `./scripts/skills.sh add vercel-labs/agent-skills`.
