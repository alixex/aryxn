## **Privacy & Security**

### 🔒 **Your Data, Your Control**

- **Local-first architecture**: All sensitive information (private keys, master password, encrypted data) is stored and encrypted locally in your browser—never sent to any server
- **Zero-knowledge design**: Aryxn never collects, stores, or has access to your data. We can't see what you store, even if we wanted to
- **Privacy by default**: Designed to minimize centralized dependencies and reduce trust assumptions—you remain in full control
- **Browser-native**: The entire application operates entirely in your browser, with no backend servers handling your sensitive data

### 🛡️ **Encryption & Protection**

- **End-to-end encryption**: Files are encrypted locally using industry-standard encryption before upload—only you can decrypt them
- **Master password protection**: A single master password protects all your accounts and encrypted files, giving you one key to all your data
- **Re-authentication**: Extra password confirmation required for sensitive actions like viewing private keys or exporting accounts
- **Secure by default**: All sensitive operations require explicit user confirmation—no accidental exposure of your data
